# Neural-networking

   This page is a goal-setting for course in human brain connectivity!  
   _(And getting to know GitHub)_  
***
## Where am I?

This is the starting point - where I am now. Here are some things I know **and** are related to the course

1. Psychology _(my major)_
   - neuropsychology
   - clinical psychology (mental health and its problems, neurological and neuropsychological disorders)
   - general knowledge of brain imaging
      - some hands-on with EEG
2. Neurobiology _(my minor)_
   - Neuronal communication  
   -  Some theorethical knowledge of methodology (e.g. patch clamp)
   - Other biology that might become handy (physiology, histology, genetics...)
4. A little bit of coding
   - python and java
   - It's been a while

## Where do I want to be?

Here I'll describe what I'd like to achieve during this course.

| Intended learning outcomes described on the course page | What they mean to me                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Understand why we want to study brain connectivity and model the brain as a network | - To get a broader perspective on how the brain works<br>- Learn more about modularity and how it works in practice<br>- To get a better sense what I want to specialize in |
| List brain networks and recognize different methods to define nodes and edges | - Learn about brain networks<br>- Learn to model brain networks<br>- Get more technical and in-depth knowledge about the imaging methods and how they are analyzed |
| Critically consider the multiple aspects of brain connectivity | - Learn to read and assess the articles in the field better<br>- Learn about the imaging methods' pros and cons |
